Description: Provides a programmatic interface to VegBank, the
    vegetation plot database of the Ecological Society of America's
    Panel on Vegetation Classification, hosted by the National Center
    for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS;
    <https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu>). VegBank contains vegetation plot
    data, community types recognized by the U.S. National Vegetation
    Classification and others, and all ITIS/USDA plant taxa along with
    other taxa recorded in plot records. As a VegBank API client, the
    'vegbankr' package supports querying, downloading, validating, and
    uploading vegetation plot records and other supporting information
    to and from the VegBank database.
